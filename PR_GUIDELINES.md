# Overview
This documentation explains how to submit an appropriate PR to ensure it is accepted as it is without need for any changes to the PR format itself.

# Submitting PRs
- Ensure your PR is from the `main` branch of your fork from the source repo, DO NOT CREATE unnecessary branches in your forked repo. See [how to create your change branch](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- Ensure the PR targets the `integration` branch of the source repo and DO NOT TARGET the source repo's `main` branch. PRS TARGETING the source repo's `main` branch will automatically get dismissed.

- Expect reviews to be between 10 minutes - 24 hours, this is due to the fact that at the time of writing the project only has one maintainer, depending on how meaningful your PR is it could get approved automatically or require manual review. Bear with us for now.

- Ensure your commit messages are meaningful and descriptive, DO NOT USE generic commit messages (e.g., "fixed stuff", "updates", "work in progress", "bug fixes"). Such commit messages will cause your PR to be rejected, regardless of how good it is.

- Use a clear/descriptive title and message in your PR, similar to commit messages, avoid generic titles and descriptions. The title should give a high-level overview of the changes your PR contains, and the description should explain; the change in details, any changes elsewhere in the source needed due to your changes and a reason for your changes(preferrably to resolve an issue in the source repo).

- Focus on the feedback and comments in your PR, if the PR is failed a reason or reasons will be found in your PR. Some of these reasons may be generated automatically using bots/apps or from the maintainer.

## Rule Of Thumb
PRs that follow the above guidelines will generally be approved, pending successful testing and the PR's meaningfulness.
